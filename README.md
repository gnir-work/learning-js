# JS
##### This repository contains small projects which I write for myself whenever I feel like a need to learn something new or understand a concept to its core.

Currently this repo contains the following projects:

1. [Js promises](promises-in-react/src/Timer.js) (Implemented inside a react app)
    * Promises: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
    * Await/Async: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function
2. [Flow + React](flow-with-react/src/DelayedText.js) (Implemented inside a react app)
    * Flow: https://flow.org/en/
    * Add flow to a react project created with create-react-app: https://reactjs.org/docs/static-type-checking.html
    * Configuring WebStorm to work with flow: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/using-the-flow-type-checker.html
